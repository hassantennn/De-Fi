# GreenChain â€“ AI-Powered DeFi Platform for ESG-Compliant Assets

This repository contains planning documentation for **GreenChain**, a simulated AI-driven DeFi platform designed to support tokenized ESG-compliant assets.

## ðŸ“„ Included File

- `DeFi Project 1.pdf` â€“ Full breakdown of project phases, team roles, tools, and deliverables across Blockchain, AI/ML, Big Data, Compliance, and ESG Tracking.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Goals

- Build a cross-domain simulation of an ESG-focused DeFi ecosystem.
- Integrate AI/ML to detect greenwashing and score ESG performance.
- Simulate token deployment and compliance flows.
- Visualise sustainability impact using public data and tools.

ðŸ”§ Development phases starting soon

## ðŸš€ Quickstart

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Train the ESG and greenwashing models (optional â€“ pre-trained models are
   provided in `models/`):

   ```bash
   python scripts/train_esg_model.py
   python scripts/train_greenwashing_detector.py
   ```

3. Launch the API:

   ```bash
   python api/app.py
   ```

   The `/predict` endpoint accepts JSON data with ESG metrics and free text and
   returns the predicted ESG category and a greenwashing label.
